# CT_Assessment

A basic Flutter shopping list for Chunky Tofu Studios.

## Set Up
- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have all the dependencies with `flutter pub get`

### State Management

I used BLoC for state management because it was the default and prefered option.

### Time Spent

I spent around four hours working on this project.

### Demo
